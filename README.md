# Extracting-Orderbook-to-Enable-Ripple-Auto-Bridging
I need to extract the orderbook table at the bottom right of this page: https://charts.ripple.com/#/markets/XRP/USD:rvYAfWj5gh67oV6fW32ZzP3Aw4Eubs59B?interval=5m&amp;range=1d&amp;type=line  Source: https://github.com/ripple/ripplecharts-frontend  They have a feature called auto-bridging that combines all liquidity across different asset classes to give you a cumulative orderbook.  So if you wanted to trade from XRP to BTC but there was only XRP to USD to BTC, the auto-bridging would automatically do this conversion through as many pairs as needed.  They don't supply this through the API for Ripple though.  We need this for our site - basically just the HTML/Javascript in your browser, but you can download as a zip here as well: https://github.com/Autodidactic-I/TheWorldExchange
